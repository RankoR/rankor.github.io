          In a team of three Android developers, in a short time from scratch, 
          I developed the kasko2go application (car insurance with an assessment of the driving style with the collected telemetry using no third-party devices).

          - Led the technical part of the marketing experiments (one subordinate — web developer).

            Slack and Firebase App Distribution

          - Restrict devices access
